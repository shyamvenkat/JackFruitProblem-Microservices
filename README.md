We have implemented five microservices:

i) Authentication service
ii) SMS notification 
iii) Email notification
iv) Push Notification 
v) Dynamic Pricing Analysis 

All these were then containarized(seperate) by docker. Later on we used bore to make those ports accessable by anyone(using bore ports).
