# JackFruitProblem-Microservices
Team 134_156_167_174

Initital Implementation:

We have implemented five microservices:

i) Authentication service
ii) SMS notification 
iii) Email notification
iv) Push Notification 
v) Dynamic Pricing Analysis 

All these were then containarized(seperate) by docker. Later on we used bore to make those ports accessable by anyone(using bore ports).

Integration with other teams(4):

The bore url was then used by each team to call and use the respective microservices, more info is provided in the readme files under each team's folder in Integration.
